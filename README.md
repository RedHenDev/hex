Web-based procedural terrain based on hexagons

to do

-b forests not generating at new chunks

-r update appearance of trees -- perhaps build from hexagons

-r huge scale of trees

DONE-f not have ui up at start

DONE-b walk button unresponsive

DONE-f new loco to incorporate VR controls and mobile

DONE-f welcome message for no cursor and sounds

-r revert to older hex-geo and geo, but implement fog fix.

DONE-r limit height of hexagons

DONE-r remove duplicate debug panel code

DONE-b address lighting and other warning messages

DONE-b viewport error

DONE-r remove redundant console logs from terrain gen

DONE-r  This offset needs to be refactored to mechanically
    work with the geometry size. Default is 5. But with
    a geometryHeight of 12, needs to be 16 or 17.
